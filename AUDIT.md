# Veritas Audit

## Current status

This repository now implements the next production-hardening pass toward the Veritas specification. The source-level path includes CLI setup/deployment generation, vLLM role configuration, OpenSearch FAISS/HNSW evidence indexing, Fuseki RDF/SPARQL graph upload, SHACL rule-pack support, formula-preserving chunking, citation extraction, bounded `/run` orchestration, command allowlisting, state/event persistence, and no legacy path that can falsely mark generated scaffolds as production-validated.

## Resolved source-level gaps

1. `/plan` is model-backed and schema-validated through the Rust API path.
2. `/run` creates a workspace, writes state, requests a plan, writes files, runs commands, retries failures, and writes a final report.
3. The legacy Python codegen path no longer emits `production_candidate_validated`; it emits `generated_unvalidated`.
4. OpenSearch is the only vector index; Qdrant/property graph claims remain out of scope.
5. SHACL service and rule pack have been added.
6. The CLI setup flow writes `.veritas/runtime.env` and `.veritas/config.yaml`; `.env.example` is intentionally removed.
7. Docker Compose includes vLLM planner/code/math services with structured-output backend flags and per-role GPU/tensor/pipeline variables.
8. PDF ingestion now produces APA citation metadata, formula-aware chunks, and RDF/OpenSearch records with richer metadata.
9. Formula extraction remains honest: Docling/regex extraction is best-effort and corpus validation is required.

## Validation executed in this sandbox

```bash
python3 -m compileall services/embedding services/ingestion services/shacl
PYTHONPATH=services/ingestion pytest -q tests/ingestion -q
python3 scripts/validate-spec.py
```

Results:

```text
Python compile: passed
Python tests: 14 passed
scripts/validate-spec.py: ok=true, failed=0, unavailable=2
```

## Commands not executed here

The following commands require a host with Rust, Docker, and GPU/model runtime:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
docker compose --env-file .veritas/runtime.env config
docker compose --env-file .veritas/runtime.env up -d
docker compose --env-file .veritas/runtime.env run --rm cli run "Implement the indexed formula as tested Rust code" --language rust
```

## Remaining host-validation boundary

I cannot honestly claim live production E2E until those commands pass on a real Docker/Rust/GPU host. The source files have been updated to meet the intended behavior, but production certification still requires live service startup, model loading, OpenSearch indexing, Fuseki querying, SHACL validation, and `/run` execution on target hardware.

## Additional hardening added after latest audit

The latest source update adds role-specific schema routing, fake-vLLM E2E scaffolding, OpenSearch mapping/migration endpoints, math-to-code endpoint, run status/resume/cancel endpoints, automatic SHACL gating before codegen, optional Docker sandbox command runner, formula image extraction metadata, and expanded ontology/RDF fields for formula image and human validation state.

New commands validated in this sandbox:

```bash
python3 -m compileall services/embedding services/ingestion services/shacl tests/fakes
PYTHONPATH=services/ingestion pytest -q tests/ingestion -q
python3 scripts/validate-spec.py
```

Observed result:

```text
Python compile: passed
Python tests: 19 passed
scripts/validate-spec.py: ok=true, failed=0, unavailable=2
```

Important remaining boundary: Rust and Docker execution still could not be run in this environment because Cargo and Docker are unavailable. The new fake-vLLM Docker profile and sandbox runner are source-level additions that must be validated on a Docker host before the project can claim complete production E2E compliance.

## Pass 1 completion update — control-plane safety

Pass 1 is now source-complete for the planned control-plane safety scope. The API no longer owns provider calls as loose helper-only routing. It now includes:

- `apps/api/src/providers.rs` with a real `ModelProvider` trait.
- `LocalVllmProvider` for the default vLLM OpenAI-compatible path.
- `RemoteOpenAICompatibleProvider` for explicitly configured remote fallback.
- `ProviderRouter` for local-first routing, retryable-error fallback, route annotation, and provider failure classification.
- `ProviderFailureCategory` for transport, timeout, unavailable model, GPU OOM, context length, rate limit, auth, schema, JSON, and upstream failures.
- `apps/api/src/schemas.rs` with role-specific JSON schemas loaded from `schemas/*.schema.json` through `include_str!`.
- `ApiFailure::from_provider_error` so provider failures become meaningful user-facing API errors with remediation.
- `scripts/validate-spec.py` now checks for the Pass 1 provider abstraction directly.

This resolves the previous source-level gap that the API used direct helper-style model calls rather than a true provider abstraction. It does not yet prove live vLLM behavior; that remains blocked by unavailable Cargo/Docker/GPU execution in this sandbox.


## Pass 2 completion update — execution safety

Pass 2 is now source-complete for the planned execution-safety scope. Veritas now persists every run as a durable workspace with `request.json`, `state.json`, `events.jsonl`, `plan_envelope.json`, `tool_outputs.json`, `automatic_shacl_report.json`, generated code package snapshots, command audit logs, validation result snapshots, retry history, and `final_report.json`. The API now uses an atomic `run.lock` file with stale-lock protection to prevent two workers from advancing the same run concurrently. `/status/:run_id` reads persisted state from disk instead of relying only on in-memory recent runs. `/run/:run_id/resume` now reloads `request.json`, reuses persisted plan/tool/SHACL artifacts when available, and continues the bounded code-generation/validation loop instead of returning a placeholder. `/run/:run_id/cancel` writes a cancellation marker and records a cancel event that the run loop checks between generation and validation steps. Command execution now writes `command_audit.jsonl` in addition to structured validation results.

This completes the source-level Pass 2 target: generated code execution has a safer audit path, run state is durable, cancellation is observable, and resume semantics are implemented around persisted artifacts and run locking. Live validation still requires Cargo and Docker on a host machine.
## Pass 5 completion update — deployment and production proof

Pass 5 is source-complete for the deployment/proof harness. The repo now includes a Docker fake-vLLM E2E profile, fake embedding service, sample math PDF fixture, service readiness waits, OpenSearch migration proof, ontology upload proof, PDF ingestion proof, `/plan` proof, `/run` proof, final-report assertions, GPU layout validation, live vLLM smoke scripts, CI workflows, and strict host-validation/production-acceptance scripts.

Important honesty boundary: this sandbox still cannot execute Cargo, Docker Compose, GPU runtime, live vLLM model loading, live OpenSearch, live Fuseki, or live SHACL. Therefore Pass 5 should be described as source-complete with a host-executable proof harness. Production certification occurs only after `scripts/validate-host.sh` and, when required, `VERITAS_REQUIRE_LIVE_VLLM_VALIDATION=true scripts/validate-host.sh` pass on the target machine.

New Pass 5 files and touched areas include:

```


## Phase 0 completion update — packaging, validation, and scoring cleanup

Phase 0 separates **source/mocked acceptance** from **live host acceptance**. The project now treats `cargo.check`, `docker.compose.config`, and `live_vllm_smoke` as `host_validation_pending` when Cargo, Docker, or GPU/vLLM runtime are unavailable. Those checks remain required for live host acceptance, but they are not scored as failed source-level checks during mocked/source validation.

Phase 0 also enforces release packaging hygiene. Every shell script under `scripts/` must be executable, and `scripts/check-packaging.sh` fails if any `*.sh` file lacks execute permissions. The GitHub Actions workflow files for Python, Rust, and Docker fake-vLLM E2E are present under `.github/workflows/`.

`scripts/production-acceptance.sh` now supports explicit profiles: `fake-ci`, `single-gpu-prod`, `multi-gpu-prod`, and `remote-model-prod`. The script records whether the run is `mocked_acceptance`, `live_gpu_acceptance`, or `remote_model_acceptance` so the audit trail cannot confuse a source/mocked proof with live GPU/vLLM production proof.

Host-validation markers:

```text
cargo.check = host_validation_pending
docker.compose.config = host_validation_pending
live_vllm_smoke = host_validation_pending
source/mocked acceptance = active
live host acceptance = pending host run
```


## Phase 2 completion update — source-mocked control-plane E2E proof

Phase 2 is source/mocked-complete for the planned E2E proof scope. The project now includes `scripts/e2e/source-mocked-control-plane-e2e.py` and `scripts/e2e/source-mocked-control-plane-e2e.sh`, which run without Cargo, Docker, OpenSearch, Fuseki, SHACL, or live vLLM. The harness validates fake planner, math, codegen, repair, human-checkpoint, and run-report payloads against the same JSON Schema contracts used by the API, writes a run workspace, intentionally fails the first validation attempt, applies a repair payload, reruns validation, records `command_audit.jsonl` and `events.jsonl`, and emits a schema-valid `final_report.json` with `production_candidate_validated` status.

This proves the control-plane artifact cascade at source/mocked level while preserving the live-host boundary: Rust compilation, Docker Compose execution, live OpenSearch/Fuseki/SHACL, and live vLLM/GPU validation remain `host_validation_pending` until executed on a proper host. `scripts/validate-host.sh --profile source-mocked` now runs packaging checks, focused Python phase tests, and the source-mocked control-plane E2E before marking source/mocked acceptance complete.

## Phase 5 completion update — SHACL and mathematical governance

Phase 5 is source/mocked-complete for the planned SHACL/math-governance scope. The automatic SHACL gate now composes both `packages/ontology/shacl/veritas-core.shacl.ttl` and `packages/ontology/shacl/veritas-math.shacl.ttl`, persists the SHACL data/shapes/report/findings artifacts, and records graph-derived SHACL context status. The source/mocked governance proof verifies that complete math-to-code RDF conforms, while incomplete symbolic shadows, incomplete mathematical discovery artifacts, and production-validated build artifacts without validation are blocked.

Command:

```bash
scripts/e2e/source-mocked-shacl-governance.sh
```

Live SHACL container execution remains `host_validation_pending` and is intentionally not claimed in the source/mocked scope.

## Phase 3 completion update — execution safety hardening

Phase 3 remains source/mocked-complete. Production-like profiles default to sandbox execution, generated file paths are confined to the run workspace, command policy rejects dangerous shell/system tokens, run locks and run indexes are persisted, and source/mocked resume/cancel tests cover active locks, stale locks, validation-pending resumes, and cancelled-run blocking.

## Phase 4 completion update — retrieval and ontology hardening

Phase 4 remains source/mocked-complete. OpenSearch mapping, vector dimension rejection, versioned alias migration, retrieval fallback, Fuseki named graph discipline, graph-store upload contracts, no-PDF-binary RDF upload, run-report RDF facts, and SPARQL planner fact summaries are validated by the source/mocked retrieval ontology proof.

## Phase 6 completion update — formula OCR and review contracts

Phase 6 is source/mocked-complete for the planned formula OCR and review scope. The ingestion layer now supports command and HTTP LaTeX OCR providers, deterministic mock formula-image rendering for CI/source validation, richer formula image metadata, citation review decisions, formula review decisions, codegen eligibility status, and OpenSearch/Fuseki persistence of those fields.

Command:

```bash
scripts/e2e/source-mocked-formula-ocr-review.sh
```

This proves the Formula → Image/OCR → Review → OpenSearch/RDF metadata contract with mocked OCR providers. Live visual OCR quality against a representative arXiv corpus remains `host_validation_pending` because it depends on the target OCR provider, Docling/PyMuPDF behavior, and the paper corpus.

## Phase 7 — Human Review Workflow Audit

Status: source/mocked complete; live host validation remains out of scope for
this phase.

Implemented:

- Shared human checkpoint state machine.
- Checkpoint phases for citation, formula, representation, plan, code
  architecture, and validation review.
- Policy gate support for `auto_approve`, `require_all`, and
  `require_high_risk_only`.
- Rejection and pending required checkpoints block workflow progress.
- Explicit `skip` with notes records a waiver.
- Checkpoints persist to `human_checkpoints.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`, RDF/Turtle,
  search records, and human workflow reports.
- API `/human/checkpoint` accepts all Phase 7 checkpoint phases and `/status/:run_id`
  returns checkpoint gate state.
- Source/mocked proof: `scripts/e2e/source-mocked-human-workflow.sh`.

Validation run expected in this environment:

```bash
scripts/e2e/source-mocked-human-workflow.sh
PYTHONPATH=services/ingestion pytest -q tests/ingestion/test_phase7_human_workflow.py
```

<!-- PHASE8_SCORECARD:START -->
## Phase 8 — Documentation and Metric Automation

- Source/mocked average score: **94.06%**.
- All non-skipped source/mocked features are A/B: **True**.
- Live host dimensions are explicitly marked `host_validation_pending`: Rust/Cargo, Docker E2E, and live vLLM/GPU validation.
- Generated artifacts: `data/scorecard/feature-scorecard.json` and `FEATURE_SCORECARD.md`.

See `FEATURE_SCORECARD.md` for the generated feature table.
<!-- PHASE8_SCORECARD:END -->


## Phase 1 Real Journey Orchestrator Audit

Status: source-level implemented.

The real journey orchestrator adds API endpoints and CLI commands for a single end-user workflow. It creates a real run workspace, records source and lifecycle artifacts, accepts human journey reviews, supports status/resume/report, and delegates to the existing autonomous run core rather than source-mocked scripts.

Phase 2 now attaches real local ingestion artifacts before planning/codegen. Later phases must add evidence-registry gates, pre-codegen human gates, default-on SHACL enforcement, tool-verified math, artifact decision logic, and behavior-derived scorecards.


## Phase 2 Real Local Ingestion Backend Audit

Status: implemented at application/source level; live Rust/API execution remains host-validation pending.

The local ingestion backend now parses real PDFs, writes `chunks.jsonl`, `formulas.jsonl`, `citations.jsonl`, `evidence.ttl`, `local_lexical_index.jsonl`, `local_vector_index.jsonl`, `evidence_manifest.json`, `formula_manifest.json`, `citation_manifest.json`, `review_queue.json`, and `ingestion_report.md`. The backend never fabricates embeddings. If no real embedding provider is available, `evidence_manifest.json` sets `planning_status=blocked_retrieval_unavailable`, and the Journey orchestrator blocks before delegating into planning/codegen.

Validation evidence in this environment:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=services/ingestion pytest -q tests/ingestion/test_phase2_real_local_ingestion_backend.py
python3 scripts/validate-spec.py
```

Remaining work: later phases must make formula/citation review decisions globally authoritative and enforce all human/governance gates before codegen.

## Phase 3 audit note: Evidence Eligibility Registry

Implemented the first causal evidence gate. Local ingestion now writes `evidence_registry.json` and `evidence_eligibility.json`. Citation and formula review commands refresh the registry from the updated chunks file. `/math-to-code` now blocks rejected, pending, low-confidence, or missing-citation formulas before model calls. Journey mode reads the registry and blocks planning with `awaiting_evidence_review` when citations/formulas are not eligible.

Host-only validation remains pending for Rust compilation and live services, but the Python ingestion/registry path is executable in this environment.

## Phase 4 Audit — Pre-Execution Gate Engine

Phase 4 addresses the prior critical gap where human checkpoints were checked after code generation and validation. The real application path now invokes `gates::run_pre_codegen_gates` before `build_code_generation_prompt`, `write_generated_files`, and `run_command` execute.

Resolved behavior:

- Missing `plan_review` blocks before codegen.
- Missing `code_architecture_review` blocks before codegen.
- Rejected or ineligible evidence blocks before codegen.
- Math-heavy runs require representation and math-tool readiness artifacts before codegen.
- Enforced SHACL failures block before codegen.
- Blocked runs write final reports with `files_changed=[]` and `commands_run=[]`.

Remaining future work:

- Phase 5 will add the real Tool-Verified Math Engine that produces `math_validation_report.json`.
- Phase 6 will make SHACL governance mode default-on and artifact-bundle based.
- Phase 7 will replace direct final-status mutation with the Artifact Decision Engine.
